"Project Management Magician (Montreal, QC)","Wanted: Project Management Magician

You:
You’re more than capable. You’re the one your teammates talk about in hushed tones. “How did he/she DO that?!?” “Is that even possible!?!”

You’re able to make things work when others crumble under the pressure. You’re beyond just being “motivated” or a “self-starter”. We know that when we toss you the keys you’re going to excel and exceed our expectations. Because that’s what you do.

You’re a grown-up. You know how to hit your deadlines and stay in touch when things get tricky. You’re a professional. You don’t need us to babysit you or tie your shoes. You’ll be telecommuting, and you’ll handle that responsibility like a champ.

Oh, and you know how to communicate too. Because it’s better to say “No” right now than it is to say “Yes” and screw something up six months down the line because you were afraid to speak your truth.

Us:

We’re the employer you dreamed about while you were in college. Yep, we “get” you. We’ll recognize your wins, and reward you for them. We’ll help coach you past your weak points. We all have them. And we’re okay if you’re able to help us find our weak points too. We’re secretly hoping to find a new best friend and growth partner.

If you’re capable and you have the personality to help us drive this thing forward instead of us having to drag you, we want to have a conversation. Send a resume, and do it quickly, before somebody else does.

PS- Let me repeat. PLEASE have a personality. You’ll find us a charming, fun environment to work and grow. If you’re capable, we’ll be your biggest cheerleaders and help drive you to every success.

PPS- We also need you to have some relevant experience.

Namely:

• Bachelor's degree, ideally in Computer Science
• Lead development teams to complete integration tasks on time and on budget
• Ability to coordinate with the development team about their additions to repositories
• Exceptional communication with clients to pair their needs and expectations with the development of timelines and budget
• Coordinate with development architectural staff for the framing of tasks for clients’ needs
• Oversee quality assurance testing and deployment schedules
• 5+ years’ experience with e-commerce and platforms like Magento, Shopify, and WooCommerce preferred
